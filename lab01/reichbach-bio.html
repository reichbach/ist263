    My major is Cyber Security in the iSchool here at Syracuse University. I am very interested in the topic, mostly vulnerabilities in companies in the web3 space. Outside of school I enjoy watching hockey, playing tennis and creating web3 projects which I have been involved in since 2019. I have four siblings and I grew up in Long Island, NY and moved to Charlotte, NC.
